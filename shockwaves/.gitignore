# More information here https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html
**/Cargo.lock

#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore

#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
