# clash-shockwaves

Shockwaves is a typed waveform viewer solution for Clash. It consists of two parts:

1. A Haskell library (`Clash.Shockwaves`) that provides tools for representing Haskell types as waveforms,
   customizing the appearance, and performing tracing simulations that store additional translation information.
2. An extension to the Surfer waveform viewer, that can use this additional information to display the waveforms.


## File format

Shockwaves uses a JSON file to store the translation data. The file has the
following structure:

```
{
    "signals": {
        "<signal>": "<type>",
        ...
    },
    "types": {
        "<type>": <translator>,
        ...
    },
    "luts": {
        "<lut>": {
            "<binary>": <translation>,
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

The `signals` key stores the type of each signal. `types` stores the translators
of all types. `luts` stores the lookup tables.

`<signal>` denotes a signal path, i.e. `module.submodule.signal`. This path
must match the structure in the VCD file. Standard tracing will result in
`logic.<trace name>`.

`<type>` is a unique identifier for the type. Shockwaves generates these in the
form `<fingerprint>: <human readable>`.

`<lut>` is an identifier for the LUT, and will usually just be the type
identifier.

`<binary>` is the raw VCD value, consisting of the characters `10x`.

### Translations

`<translation>` is a translation. It takes the format `[<render>,<subs>]` where
`<render>` is either `null` or `["<label>",<style>,<prec>]`. `<label>` is the
text to be displayed. `<prec>` is a number from 0 to 11 denoting the operator
precedence.
`<style>` is the wavestyle:
- `"N"` for normal
- `"W"` for warn
- `"E"` for error
- `{"C":[<R>,<G>,<B>,<A>]}` for custom colors - `<R>`,`<G>`,`<B>`,`<A>` are all
  8-bit unsigned values, and `<A>` is usually fixed to `255`.

`<subs>` is a list of subsignal translations taking the form `[["<sub>",<translation>],...]` where `<sub>` is the subsignal name.


### Translators

A translator looks like `[<bits>,<variant>]`. Here `<bits>` denotes the number
of bits parsed by the translator, and `<variant>` the translator variant.

There are many translator variants available:

- `{"R":"<type">}`: a reference to another translator
- `{"L":"<lut>"}`: a reference to a lookup table.
- `{"S":[<translator>,...]}`: a sum type where the translator is picked base on the most significant bits.
- `{"P":{...}}`: a product type. The keys are as follows:
  - `"t":[<sub> | null,<translator>]`: a list of translators used to parse consecutive blocks of bits. If `<sub>` is omitted, no subsignal is created.
  - `"[":"<start>"`: the opening string
  - `",":"<sep>"`: the separator string
  - `"]":"<stop>"`: the terminating string
  - `"n":["<label>",...]`: a list of labels to insert before values (may be omitted)
  - `"p":<prec>`: the precedence to compare subsignal values to
  - `"P":<prec>`: the precedence of the output
  - `"s":<index>`: the index of the signal whose style to copy. `-1` to disable.
- `{"A":{...}}`: an array of multiple values of the same type. The keys are as follows:
  - `"t":<translator>`: the translator to use for the contained values.
  - `"l":<len>`: the number of values in the array.
  - `"[":"<start>"`: the opening string
  - `",":"<sep>"`: the separator string
  - `"]":"<stop>"`: the terminating string
  - `"p":<prec>`: the precedence to compare subsignal values to
  - `"P":<prec>`: the precedence of the output
- `{"N":{"f":<format>}}`: a number. `<format>` can be:
  - `"U"`: unsigned
  - `"S"`: signed
  - `"H"`: hexadecimal
  - `"O"`: octal
  - `"B"`: binary
- `{"D":["<sub>",<translator>]}`: put the output of `<translator>` in subsignal `<sub>` and copy its value.
- `{"X":[<style>,<translator>]}`: apply a style to the output of `<translator>`.
- `{"C":<translation>}`: a constant translation value.
