# Shockwaves Surfer extension

This is the Surfer extension for the Shockwaves system. It looks for JSON files containing
translation metadata, as well as several config files.


## Installation

Either download the precompiled version, or compile using the `compile.sh` script in this
directory. The `compile.sh` script can be provided the arguments `linux` or `windows` to
automatically place the created plugin in the default directory on that system.

## Using the plugin

After installing the plugin, there's nothing you need to do! Everything is detected
automatically, and should work out of the box. If you want to configure Shockwaves,
have a look at the [HOWTO guide](../docs/howto/CONFIG.md).

If you run into any trouble, note that the extension prints a lot of useful information
that might help you.
